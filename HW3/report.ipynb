    "Initially I chose rainbowcrack to crack the hashes. However, after the first rainbow table was generated, I realised that rcrack was only able to crack 3 hashes out of 148. The hash table that I generated over 3 hours (min length = 1, max length = 15, chain length = 10000, number of chains = 10000000) was too small for rcrack to find all the hashes. Thus, I found that it was unfeasible to generate a large enough hash table that could break all the hashes.\n",

Hashcat was a good choice since it utilizes the GPU for the computation of the hashes, allowing for much faster computation as compared to using the CPU. However, after running for about a day, it only managed to exhaust all the password combinations till 7 characters long. To exhaust all the 8 character passwords, the estimated time of completion was 12 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, I decided to try another method that hashcat offered, the dictionary + mask attack, named as a hybrid attack in hashcat. I used the rockyou.txt wordlist and appended to it 1-3 characters. Since trying out all the characters in the string.printable list is still not too computationally expensive, needing only 30minutes to complete the attack, I went with 3 characters at the maximum. After appending the characters to the wordlist, I re-ran the attack by prepending characters to the wordlist. This is to cover the cases where the salt is prepended to the password."
